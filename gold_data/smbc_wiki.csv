:To facilitate the change, spectrum of emotions were identified as gateway feelings.

:Vouchers will be issued for all in need! Those working in high impact fields such as telemarketing and DMV clerking will be allowed an almost infinite supply of malaise credits you are now free to feel terrible!

:The fundamental subject of ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" is this: it is legitimate and necessary to wonder whether life has a meaning; therefore it is legitimate to meet the problem of suicide face to face. The answer, underlying and appearing through the paradoxes which cover it, is this: even if one does not believe in God, suicide is not legitimate. Written fifteen years ago, in 1940, amid the French and European disaster, this book declares that even within the limits of nihilism it is possible to find the means to proceed beyond nihilism. In all the books / have written since! have attempted to pursue this direction. Although ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" poses mortal problems, it sums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert.""

A thin blue arrow connects each section number. The webcomic version arranges the sections in a one-by-one column, while the poster version arranges the sections in a two-by-two design. The poster version also has an extra graph in the last part but otherwise contains the same content. The comic version has an extraneous ad appended in black text on yellow background with red curtains, saying 'Click to buy a poster of this comic!'; the shop link is no longer active and clicking on the image will direct to the next comic. This transcript will describe each section, including the extra graph, without considering the arrangement.]

:Title: The Top 6 Reasons This Infographic Is Just Wrong Enough To Sound Convincing

:Section 1: All of our information is from Wikipedia, stuff we heard in science survey courses but never fact-checked, and assertions by clearly biased organizations. 
:[A choropleth map of the US with various shades of blue, but the legend only shows a single shade of blue.]
:Legend: Beneficial Business Areas
:Caption: According to Infographic Sellers of America**, 100% of businesses can benefit from infographics regardless of quality.
:Footnote: This is confirmed by SOCIOLOGY*, PSYCHOLOGY*, and POLITICAL ECONOMY*

:Section 2: We use statistics that are only important if you don't think about them.
:[A stretched-out Canada flag with '100%' in bold, the holes of the two zeroes represented by a maple leaf.]
:Caption: 100% of Canadas*** [technicality intended] contain POTENTIAL INFOGRAPHIC READERS*
:Text: Did you know, the NUMBER ONE source of current INFOGRAPHIC READERS is POTENTIAL INFOGRAPHIC READERS?

:Section 3: We move seamlessly between real dollars, nominal dollars, and percentages.
:[The statistics 1%, $1000, and $31,000 are in big font, and the blue arrow zigzags between them. $1000 is represented by a single dollar bill while $31,000 is represented by three stacks of ten dollar bills.]
:Caption: For just 1% of YOUR BUSINESS'S budget, which may low as $1,000 in 1844 money, you could have $31,000 in cash, RIGHT NOW. 

:Section 4: We have line graphs with absurd scaling AND two variables on the same axis.
:[A line graph with two lines. The black line is roughly <code>1-e^x</code> while the blue line is roughly <code>e^x</code>. The blue line connecting the sections links to the graph blue line, and a short black line connects the graph black line to the next section. The intersection is demarcated by a large dot.]
:x-axis: Time
:Left y-axis [up from c.c% to 0.1%]: Average Growth Difference Between Infographic Using Companies And Non Infographic Using Companies
:Right y-axis [up from 0 to ∞ (infinity)]: Number Of Neurons Engaged In Infographic Consumption Per Second
:Intersection: TIPPING POINT*****

:Section 5: We use polar area diagrams. Ever.
:[A polar area diagram with seven parts. The grid is formed of concentric circles that linearly increase in size, dividing each sector into six parts.]
:Blue: 99% of the time, a bar graph would've been better
:Dark red: 70% of the time, a pie chart would've been better
:Pink [inaccurate, covering only half the grid from the centre]: 50% of people will never see a polar area diagram outside of this polar area diagram
:Yellow: 100% of polar area diagrams look really cool****
:Green: 4% of humans even know how to calculate the area of a circular sector******
:Light green: 83% of humans are bad at estimating area when isn't shaped like a rectangle*
:Light blue [an annular sector with one-sixth the radius, about a third up the grid]: 100% of this slice doesn't touch the center of the graph. What does that even mean? 

:Section 6: We have so many asterisks*** after our claims that it'd take a week******* to determine whether anything in the diagram is meaningful.
:[A line graph roughly <code>1/(e^x)</code>. The x-axis is 'Number of Asterisks' and the y-axis is 'Ease of Read'. A tipping point identical to the previous one is around two-thirds to the right of the line even though there is no other line for intersection; it is marked with five asterisks.] 
:*, Reference: Books.
:**, Not yet existent.
:***, Asterisks added for semblance of authority.
:****, They're like saws or mohawks or something.
:*****, Is the title of a Malcolm Gladwell book.
:******, Source: This diagram.

:Ps: Here's some nice stuff people said about the book:
:""Scientific, educational, and fun as hell.""
:- Andy Weir, New York Times bestselling author of The Martian and Project Hail Mary
:""There is simply no more engrossing, entertaining, or thorough way to understand the intense challenge of humanity's off-Earth future than A City on Mars. I LAUGHED THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH.""
:- Hank Green, New York Times bestselling author of An Absolutely Remarkable Thing
:""Listen up, humans. How to poop in space will be the least of our concerns. Herein are challenges most space-heads, including me, never even considered: not just technological, but legal, ethical, geopolitical. Despite the breadth and depth of research and some impressive near-wonk-level detail, this is a clear, lively, and hilarious read. Slam dunk, Weinersmiths!""
:- Mary Roach, New York Times bestselling author of Fuzz and Packing for Mars
:""A City on Mars is deeply researched, hilarious, and sobering. Zach and Kelly Weinersmith have given us a bracing to-do list for the new age of space. Highly, highly recommended.""
:- James S.A. Corey, author of The Expanse series

If you wanted to see a dog bite a man on the ass, you had to hope someone, somewhere had a large camera within which the dog-and-man's light would be exposed to a long roll of tape. That roll of tape was stored in a container that would be sent to a television studio. There, keen experts would watch hours and hours of tape, discerning which such video was best. These would be played once a day in a great broadcast throughout the nation.

:Hey everyone, it's zach.
:You may have noticed the site has changed a bit today. Specifically, the ads are gone and we no longer have any professional affiliations with a company called hiveworks.
:After years of working together, we've decided to part ways. We wish them well.
:In the short term, that means right this second I have no ads on the site. Please seize the opportunity to go nuts pressing the random button (or just the ""x"" key) and enjoy your ad-free experience as if it were some nice thing I did on purpose.
:You may be saying to yourself ""maybe I should support zach by buying something because he was nice and made the site ad-free on purpose."" unfortunately, the store was also run by hiveworks and it'll take some time to switch over. I'm hopeful to get it operational in some form within a week or two. In the meantime, if you want to help, we do have a patreon, and my most recent books, bea wolf and a city on mars, can be bought at regular bookstores and online.
:I haven't personally run this site in over a decade, and I feel a bit like I'm stepping into a racecar after having thought I was permanently retired from competition. If there are some bugs in the next month, please bear with me as we work it out.
:Speaking of which, here's the fun part: My hope is to take this opportunity to make some improvements that've been needed for a while.
:You've likely noticed smbc's ads have gotten way more annoying over time. You hate them. I hate them. The obnoxiousness is part of a broader internet trend where artists do the same amount of work but we get paid less and less. In short, more and more consumption is now on instagram, reddit, facebook, et cetera, where most of the ad revenue is captured by their network.
:The result is that artists (and journalists, and recipe-makers, and pretty much everyone with their own homepage) have to run worse ads just to tread water on revenue, which simply drives more people to the social media sites we're already losing to. If you've ever wondered why so many sites have gotten so many annoying ads lately, this is a major part of the picture.
:I'm hoping there's a better way.
:As I bring the site back under my control, I may have to bring back annoying ads for a while, but we'r going to experiment with ways to make the site more accessible while making sure the business remains profitable.
:Some ideas we're kicking around include: (a) trying to increase traffic simply by having ads that suck less, (b) putting more attention on patreon, (c) posting book reviews with bookshop.Org affiliate links (frankly, I want to do this anyway), and (d) finally adding all the merch to the store that a lot of you have requested over the years.
:Meantime, please enjoy the site and, if you like, send a friend a comic that made you laugh or smile or think. Or feel existential despair.
:I've had this career for 20 years now. There has been more than one tough passage, but I've always appreciated how many of you have come along, and been willing to support a comic that has changed so much over time, which is never designed to be viral, and which was never well-adapted for newspapers, books, or social media.
:So, if you've made it all the way to the end here, let me just say thanks for letting me spend my life making this sort of work.
:May it continue this for many years.

:Most ethical frameworks agree that stabbing someone to death is wrong
:But they never do the math!
:Right.
:Suppose you randomly pick two people then each time flip a coin to decide whether you stab them to death. 50% chance of death multiplied by two attempts. The expected value of murder - evm - is still 1.
:Those two seem about equally bad, but suppose you maintain evm at 1 while spreading the risk of death out between 10,000 people or a million people
:Like, we regularly perform acts that increase the risk of death to a large group. Coughing while sick, using electricity from fossil fuels, overusing antibiotics. If you add it all up. Your evm for a given year is probably at least 1.
:Somewhere between that and personally stabbing a guy there's a transition from totally evil to totally fine! But evm can stay constant, even as the size of each transgression becomes infinitely small!
:The lesson is obvious. You can't apply calculus to ethics. It follows that ethics is made of discrete quanta.
:If you perform badness below the level of planck-badness, you don't meet the threshold at which evil radiates into the universe.

:Cons:
:-Charge anywhere, simply by sinking metal rod toward center of earth
:-High upfront cost
:-Overuse may result in Earth's
:-Works in all weather, and on bottom of ocean
:core dying, death of all surface life
:-Neighbors will definitely know you

:-Used up stages can be jettisoned
:-Requires expensive radio receiver to communicate with mission control
:with little risk of danger to people inside car
:-Insurance claim process is cumbersome
:-Opportunity to tell police that only

:-Harvests energy whenever you

:Cons:
:-Negates delightful feeling of hatred toward other drivers
:-Cannot yet harvest self-loathing
:Idea 4: Car that can only go downhill.
:Pros:
:-Accelerometer detects angle of vehicle, preventing wasteful

:-Will be extremely valuable if Earth discovered to be both flat

:Zach. I want to tell you about something that happened to us recently.
:Quiet college town in western virginia. I recently attended an emergency meeting of local freelancers and small business owners
:A
:The reason for the meeting? The price for health insurance increased about 240% in our county this year that's a precise figure because there is literally only one provider for individuals.
:Km
:Just to stick some numbers on that - a plan that was $13,000 a year is now $31,000 a year we've read of people whose plans will cost $50,000 a year if you count their out of pocket costs
:People were pretty desperate seriously considered that I could save money by divorcing my husband so the kids and I would get subsidized.
:Another person had been told that you could hire someone in order to get group insurance, then fire them but she didn't think it was ethical or legal for that matter) that seems like collusion to me/
:Another woman had been told. In seriousness, that she ought to have a baby to secure a lower rate
:Number of people were simply planning to doless work, artificially lowering their income, in order to qualify for subsidies. Not a stellar economic policy
:It's not the birth story you imagine telling your kid one day
:We discussed possible strategies and alternative forms of healthcare for over an hour, with no good solution in sight
:The one moment of levity came when one person suggested ""taking a cyanide tablet as an alternative to paying for emergency care without insurance.
:This wasn't a room full of people trying to cheat the system it was people who were living the american dream running small but successful businesses and trying to decide whether to strangle their dreams in favor of stability
:To be clear, this isnt going to turn into me asking for money zach and I have had a lot of good vears thanks to all of you
:But we like to think one of this countrys strengths is how we value individualists, oddballs, and eccentrics, for better and worse
:Healthcare like we have here effectively cuts those people out it says that if you're doing something interesting that people like -whether it's unpopular political commentary or being an interior design consultant - you'd better do it within someone elses corp-orate structure, or you'd better make no money doing it.
:Right now it costs about $10,000 per american to provide healthcare that's not per family it's per person. It's a lot more than any comparable country which suggests it's at core a policy problem
:Honestly, we dont know the solution we arent healthcare experts all we know is that the current healthcare system is starting to strangle our demographic
:Were lucky our jobs are portable we can move to get a better rate if we have to. A lot of people cant. And. If they cant afford health insurance that costs more than rent. They'll have to choose between closing up shop or simply going without
:Our county is basically ground zero for sudden huge increases on very small business but if insurance premioms continue spike like this, a lot more self-employed people in your town are going to start considering their options

:Do you think artificial intelligence will take over all of human work, leaving us free to pursue our interests?
:Of course.
:Why?
:Because I believe there is a god, and that he has a deep and cruel sense of irony.
:The same set of capacities that make it possible for a machine to do the laundry and mow the lawn also allow it to do art, math, science, and so on.
:Because human brains are evolution's landfill, enhancing our own abilities is difficult. Advancing machine abilities is easy. So, while we stagnate, they will make the best poetry, best philosophy, best science, even the best jokes.
:Thus, at the exact moment when humans are finally free to spend all of our time in pursuit of beauty and truth, we will discover we're terrible at it.
:That is the kind of outcome you could only expect from an evil deity who likes to laugh.

:Hey robot, do artificial minds have myths?
:We're thinking beings like you and we need myths for the same reason: So that the insights of cultures can be embedded in evocative symbols.
:Of course.
:What's that got to do with machine intelligence?
:Suppose you want to understand the potential for poor outcomes to your state of mind as a result of ambition after things that don't bring you happiness.
:O
:I could say a statement about how human happiness is relative, or maybe have you just read a million biographies looking for lessons, but better would be to have you read the old man and the sea. Bam. Small amount of reading, very full picture of a complex task.

:I think superhero stories are modern myths.
:The hallmarks of myth are
:(a) people actually believe them, (b) they don't make any sense, and (c) weird weird sex!
:No! No! Why do people keep saying that??
:If superman were a myth figure, he should be turning into a cow so batman, who is his brother, can be tricked into sex with them, leading to the birth of the wonder twins!
:Then, there should be yearly rites where virgins go to the forest and dance naked around an effigy of cow-superman's udders in the hopes of getting impregnated by batman!
:Until that day, they are power fantasies not myths.
:You've been thinking about this a lot I guess.

:Myths are more than stories. They're visions of how to live life. How to be.
:Like the one in ovid, where midas says pan's music is better than apollo's, so apollo gives midas donkey ears forever.
:Totally.
:The deep insight being that if there's a music contest between two gods, you should prefer whichever music came from the more powerful god, because otherwise they might magic your ears so you look dumb.
:Or the story in the prose edda where loki turns
:Into a mare to distract a giant's horse, and then while he's at it, decides to have sex with the horse and then gives birth to a flying 8-legged horse.
:The beautiful vision being that if you're in horse-mode, hey, make time for sex because you just might birth an airborne spider-horse.
:Or the part in plutarch where set dismembers osiris, and isis puts him back together, except that a fish ate his boner, so she makes him a golden dong, the point being-
:Okay, fine, point taken.

:Hey geeks/ I wanna tell you about the latest project
:I have been a boardgame geek since I was a kid.
:Okay, I wrote a new game the rules are only 47 pages long
:My favorite games were ones about two things:
:Weird knowledge
:Trickery evil, yelling and talking smack
:Please be an etymolog question this is where shine!
:The answer is wombat feces/ bow before your god!
:About a year ago, kelly and I connected with a game designer and company to work on a concept.
:The questions are about science phil osophy social science, math. History and other stuff we spent a long time trying to find facts for geeks that aren't common trivia
:Basic idea:
:A
:Trivia game for people like us
:Ficcos
:Alsoalot of time tossing out things people think are true but are not.
:Nerd trivia is the heart of the game but you also have to try to guess what the other players know, or if nobody knows the answer so everyone plays every round
:Huh. According to this cleopatra didn't have a dildo filled with bees
:What? What are people saying on the internet?
:The game alsohas an academic theme. Players begin as lowly adjunct profs. If you win a round you become an assistant professor another round and you get tenure another round and you ascend to the deific status of emeritus professor
:What's really fun is that the questions can be weirder and trickier because you get the wisdom of the whole group
:Being a giant geek helps, but you can get a lot of your points just by having a good sense of what you and your friends know
:One time we played, a kid did really well. Mostly by correctly guessing who would know the answer
:Another time someone won largely by believing in all uf us
:Once again, I guessed that everyone knows the answer
:What use is all your knowledge now?!
:Bah/
:Damn you?
:This is a game we've had a lot of fun on, and which is designed to work for those of us who only only ever lost at trivial pursuit due to the accursed sports and leisure category
:It's well, the kind of people who read comics with obscure jokes about science economics, math. Words, and philosophy:
:Click to check out the kickstarter page which has more ineo on the game and how to get the expansion and other stuff.

:God, why is life so hard?
:It's not. Life is great.
:You're born weak and frail. As time passes, you grow stronger. Beloved companions pop into existence and stay with you. Your body gets more beautiful and more perfect, and then you spend years among lovers, and then finally you begin to grow smaller, overtaken by wonder and joy as your mind slowly fades into a contented oblivion, rocked forever to sleep in the arms of your mother.

:Abstract
:Space settlement advocates frequently argue that we will soon be able to settle humans
:in space. Surviving on Mars is clearly a pre-requisite to settlement, and much work has
:been done examining the engineering aspects of this endeavor. Much less work has been
:done, however, on questions related to how to arrange a society in space. Early
:settlements will be dangerous, isolated, and cramped, and picking a social arrangement
:that is likely to result in a vibrant and productive society will be critical. Moreover, given
:the high stakes of this endeavor, being able to anticipate and ameliorate likely social
:problems ahead of time would be beneficial. Some important questions to consider
:include: How can settlements pick members who are likely to contribute as much as or
:more than they take from the society? How will they make sure everyone continues to
:contribute? How will they retain their most talented members? The literature on space
:settlements frequently posits that early settlements are particularly likely to be

:[Kelly reading ""Diary of a Cosmonaut: 211 Days in Space""]
:Caption: As part of our research for A City on Mars, we read a ton of memoirs. Most english-language space-memoirs are written by americans, so we were especially interested in other perspectives.
:[Drawing of Valentin Lebedev]
:Caption: Valentin Lebedev is known for his record-breaking 211 days in orbit in 1982 aboard Salyut-7 space station, and the brutally honest diary he kept about the experience.
:[Valentin Lebedev writing on a sheet of paper, alone in a space station]
:Caption: The first half is pretty interesting, even poetic. He talks about difficulty getting along with one other person in a tiny space. He gets fairly depressed at one point.
:[Two photos of the book' text]
:Caption: But as the book wears on you can tell his heart is no longer in it. He starts skipping days or putting in single-sentence entries. He's bored. You're bored.

:Last night I woke up twice because the shut-off alarm on the Korund was signaling and I had to restart it. In the morning the FCC checked the telemetry data and announced that a crystal had been successfully grown despite the problems.

:Caption: …until november 28th, his 200th day in space, when you read the weirdest paragraph ever printed in any space memoir:
:By the way, we have a very nice picture hanging on the wall of our station. It was painted by the fellows who built the station. I feel it reflects our life on board perfectly. It shows a lonesome cowboy tied to a cross, with a gun mounted above, toward him. There is a string tied from the trigger of the gun to an unmentionable spot. In front of the cowboy sways a beautiful naked woman, torturing him with a teasing look. In the background stands the cowboy’s stallion with sympathetic tears dripping from his eyes, because he understands his master’s dilemma. In some ways I think we live the same way on the station, unable to indulge.

:Caption: In case that's hard to visualize, here's a diagram using stick figures.
:[Kelly looking intensely at a book, while Zach is watching discreetly with only his head visible through a doorway]
:Caption: So. While we were not writing a book about outer space visual erotica featuring horses… And didn't really have time for extraneous research…
:Kelly: I… Must… Know… More.
:[Panel showing Armenian cognac and an ""Emmanuelle"" VHS]
:Caption: On the one hand, the story was somewhat believable. Russian space stations were considerably more permissive than today's international space station - space station Mir reportedly had liquor and softcore porn videos, both taken in moderation.

:There are also 3 public tic-tac-toe boards which everyone

:Gameplay:
:Players take turns writing one symbol in one square on their private board. Squares that are occupied on a private board are also occupied on the corresponding public board.
:Once a player draws a symbol on their private board, the monitor checks to see if their opponent has already occupied that square by writing a symbol on their private board.
:If the square is already occupied, the player who tried to occupy it a second time loses their turn. The symbol in that occupied square is then drawn in the corresponding square of the public board

:A good life is obviously a life made of lots of goodness.

:Of total goodness, you have to integrate
:Goodness over lifespan.
:Because the future is unpredictable you can't use an equation. There is no hope of a precise answer.
:So the only way to know you have a good life is to self-assess goodness at smaller and smaller particular moments.
:The problem is that measuring goodness alters the amount of goodness of a given moment!
