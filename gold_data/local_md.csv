Are you familiar with the concept of a Dutch auction?

You set a price for an item. Then, you lower the price down and down until you find a bidder above your reserve-price.

If you get no bidders, you overvalued the item. So, you restart the auction at a lower reserve-price. Repeat until a taker comes. Voila, you've found the best that you could get.

Mom said lasting love isn't found, it's created together.

Yes, the equilibrium strategy is to destroy your partner's market value.

Notice it crossed the ""Hitler Threshold"" on 18 occasions, with 3 unrelated ""Führer-Clusters"" at morning, during a conference call, and when you woke up in the middle of the night.

We are not!

Watch this. I'll tell you a completely abstract story:

There was a person who loved another person. But conditions compelled one of the people to cross a large body of water. Later, without realizing it, when it was night, they would look across their respective ends of the large body of water and think of each other.

Two men fight on either side of a war. All of their friends die and they are very angry for many years. Later they are very old, and they meet, and they spontaneously hug each other and cry.

Once there was an old human who was sick. The sick human had an estranged child. After the sick human had suffered brain damage and had no consciousness, the estranged child took care of the sick human's body until it died.

**WAAA**

We must leave until they find a way to be less weird!

When a predator is near, they jump up high, in a conspicuous display that appears to waste calories.

The best evolutionary theory is that stotting is an ""honest signal"". It tells the predator ""I'm too athletic to catch. Eat someone else.""

In order to test the theory, we equipped a random deer with jet-oots. It was then able to ""stott"" up to 4,000 meters high.

As expected, local carnivores came to worship the modified deer as a god.

The effect was so robust that it also affected omnivores.

Hey, anyone else wanna go worship te all-glorious sky-deer?

You read my mind, dude!

The results were transmitted via peer-reviewed journals.

The new god's magisterium expanded.

By presidential decree, from now on, the reindeer drive santa.

The unifying effects were profound.

Let us end war. Let us end borders.

We are brothers under jet-deer's heaven.

Later, a bird of prey took down the deer.

You start siding with all the villains.

Most kids' stories are written by people in their 20s and 30s, and they target children. Most villains are middle-aged. This creates misunderstanding.

Consider the Durslays from Harry Potter. Are they perfect? No. But they took in an orphan boy after his parents got killed doing stuff the Dursleys told them was dangerous.

They raised him for eleven years!

Look at Scrooge. Why is Scrooge bad? Because his layabout nephew demands money for an unvetted charity? Think about how many mortgage's Scrooge's bank deposits have paid for?

Emperor Palpatine! He assumes control over an anarchic ""republic"" of in-fighting factions and immediately builds up state capacity, which would have eventually resulted in a modern-style parliament if he weren't thwarted by monarchs, religious terrorists and people who insist their bloodlines entitle them to rule!

People think kids are kinder than adults, but kids would happily round up and execute anyone Pikachu said was bad.

Hard work.

If you really focus and dedicate yourself, and really **care** about your future, you can personally sabotage every single one of your peers.

My strategy is to work non-stop and barely sleep, but then act as if life is easy whenever I go to the office. This discourages co-workers or drives them to mental health crises, while simultaneously impressing my bosses.

If I can keep it up for five more years, I'll be in a position to delegate all my work to people just like me. I will enjoy several decades of rising pay for minimal work until I die at my desk and they pick over my corpse like starved animals.

Pick away, you jackals! You can't hurt a man whose soul's already in hell! Hahahahaha!

**AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH**
